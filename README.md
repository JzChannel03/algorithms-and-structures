# Welcome to the Algorithms and Data Structures Repository

This repository is dedicated to the implementation of various algorithms and data structures in multiple programming languages. Each branch is intended to contain implementations in a specific language, along with examples, explanations, and test cases to help you understand and apply these concepts.

## Branches

- **csharp**: This branch will contain implementations of algorithms and data structures in C#. Currently, it includes a few algorithms with their tests and data structures that are still under development.

## Getting Started

To explore the algorithms and data structures, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2. **Checkout the desired branch**:

    ```bash
    git checkout <branch-name>
    ```

    For example, to check out the `csharp` branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout csharp
    ```
